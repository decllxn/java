2. Student Grading System (Intermediate)
Scenario: You're designing a grading system for a school. 
You need to create a Student class that holds a student's studentID, name, 
and a private array or list of grades (ranging from 0 to 100). 
Create methods to add new grades to the list and calculate the average grade. 
The grades should not be modified directly from outside the class.

Objective:

Implement the Student class with:
Private variables: studentID, name, and a list/array of grades.
A method to add grades (ensure grades are between 0 and 100).
A method to calculate and return the average grade.
Getter methods to retrieve the student's name and studentID.
Bonus: Create a main method to create a student, add grades, and print the average grade.
