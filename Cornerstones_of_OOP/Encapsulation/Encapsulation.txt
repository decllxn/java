ENCAPSULATION IN JAVA
- It is one of four fundamental OOP concepts
- It refers to the practice of bundling the data(variables) and the methods(functions) that operate on the data into a single unit
- Bundling the data is usually done with classes
- Encapsulation helps protect the integrity of the data by preventing outside code from directly accessing and modifying it

- Private variables: The data (or variables) of a class are typically marked as private
- Public methods: The methods that operate on the data are typically marked as public

Why Encapsulation is important
1. Data Hiding
2. Increased Flexibility
3. Control Over the Data
4. modularity - Better organization of code
5. Ease of maintenance

- Encapsulation is achieved in java through the use of access modifiers
- Access modifiers are keywords that determine the accessibility of a class, method, or variable
- Private, public, protected
