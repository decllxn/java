Simple Inventory Management System:

Scenario: Imagine you're working on an inventory management system for a small retail store. 
You need to create a class Product that represents items in the store's inventory. 
Each product should have a productID, a name, and a price. 
You should also provide methods to increase and decrease the price, but the price must never go below 0.

Objective:

Implement the Product class with proper encapsulation:
Private variables: productID, name, price
Getter methods to retrieve product details.
A method to increase the price (with a parameter for the amount).
A method to decrease the price (but ensure it doesnâ€™t go below 0).
Bonus: Test your class by creating a main method that creates a product, prints its details, increases the price, and then decreases it.
