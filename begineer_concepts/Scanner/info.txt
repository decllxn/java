JAVA USER INPUT(Scanner)

- The scanner class is used to get user input
- Found in the java.util package
- To use the scanner class, create an object of the class and use any,
  Of the available methods found in scanner
- Scanner is a complement of Formatter
- It reads formatted input and converts it into its binary form
- Scanner can be used to read input from the console, a file, a string or any ohther source that implements,
  the readable format


1. SCANNER CONSTRUCTORS

- The scanner class has several constructors
- A scanner can be created for a string, an InputStream, a File, a Path or any Object of readable format
- Example of Scanner that reads the file Test.txt:

  FileReader fin = new FileReader("Test.txt)
  Scanner src = new Scanner(fin)

- The next  line creates a Scanner that reads from standard input
  
  Scanner conin = new Scanner(System.in);

- System.in is an object of type InputStream. Thus, the call to the constructor maps to Scanner(InputStream)
- Scanner constructor methods:
  The scanner class provides multiple constructors that allow it to read input from,
  various sources, such as files, input streams and strings.

(a). Scanner(InputStream source)
- Reads from an input stream(e.g System.in)
- System.in which allows reading from the standard input keyboard

(b). Scanner(File from)
       throws FileNotFoundException
- Creates a Scanner that uses the file specified by from as a source for input
- The file must be a readable file
- This Scanner reads from a file. You need to pass a file object
- Representinfg the file you want to read from
- If the file doesn't exist, it throws a FileNotFoundException

(c). Scanner(String from)
- Creates a Scanner that uses the String specified by from as a source for input
- The entire string is treated as an input source

(d). Scanner(from a readable source)
- Uses a Readable source
- Any object that implements the Readable interface(like Reader objects) can be used as the input source
- This is the most general constructor

(e). Scanner(Path Source) thows IOException
- Creates a Scanner that uses the file specified by from as the source for input
- The file must be a readable file
- A path represents a file or directory path in the file system.
- Files.newBufferedReader(path) method is commonly used in conjunction with this constructor
- An IOException is thrown if the file is not accessible.
