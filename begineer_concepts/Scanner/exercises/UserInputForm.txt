1. Basic User Input Form (Beginner Level)

Goal: Create a simple form that collects user information 
      (e.g., name, age, email, and phone number) and 
      validates each input.

Features:
       Ask the user for their name (ensure it’s not empty).
       Ask for their age and validate it's a number.
       Prompt for their email and ensure it contains "@" and a domain.
       Request their phone number and validate that it’s numeric.

Challenges:
    Input validation (for example, check if the age is a valid integer).
    Handling invalid inputs and prompting the user to try again.
